# Lines of code:

# Your favorite editor:
# sudo vim /boot/config.txt
# Now scroll all the way to the bottom of the file and add in:
# display_rotate-X (where as X is one of the numbers below.) 

# Now do a reboot after making the change to the /boot/config.txt file, and you should have a screen tilted by the number of your desire:

# 0 = 0 degrees (the default value)
# 1 = 90 degrees
# 2 = 180 degrees
# 3 = 270 degrees

#That’s it! Quick and easy.

# What do you use your Raspberry Pi for? I just recently got mine and started playing around, mainly using it as a dashboard for my firewall now. Also will test some licensing services on it in the future and what else.
# Let me know what you use your’s for in the comments!
